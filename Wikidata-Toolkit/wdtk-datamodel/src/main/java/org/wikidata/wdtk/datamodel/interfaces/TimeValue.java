/**
 * Time values represent points and intervals in time, and additional
 * information about their format. Information includes a specific time point,
 * information about its precision, and the preferred calendar model and
 * timezone (for display). Moreover, time values can describe some uncertainty
 * regarding the exact position in time. This is achieved by tolerance values
 * that specify how much {@link #getBeforeTolerance() before} or
 * {@link #getBeforeTolerance() after} the given time point an event might have
 * occurred.
 * <p>
 * Time points cannot describe durations (which are quantities), recurring
 * events ("1st of May"), or time spans (
 * "He reigned from 1697 to 1706, i.e., during <i>every</i> moment of that time span"
 * ). Intervals expressed by times always encode uncertainty ("He died in the
 * year 546 BCE, i.e., in <i>some</i> moment within that interval").
 * <p>
 * The main time point of the value generally refers to the proleptic Gregorian
 * calendar. However, if dates are imprecise (like "Jan 1512" or even "1200")
 * then one cannot convert this reliably and Wikidata will just keep the value
 * as entered.
 * <p>
 * "Y0K issue": Neither the Gregorian nor the Julian calendar assume a year 0,
 * i.e., the year 1 BCE was followed by 1 CE in these calendars. See <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero"
 * >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero</a>. Wikibase internally uses the
 * year 0. This is the same as ISO-8601, where 1 BCE is represented as "0000".
 * However, note that XML Schema dates (1.0 and 2.0) do not have a year 0, so in
 * their case 1BCE is represented as "-1". Understanding the difference is
 * relevant for computing leap years, for computing temporal intervals, and for
 * exporting data.
 * <p>
 * Timezone information is to be given in the form of a positive or negative
 * offset with respect to UTC, measured in minutes. This information specifies
 * the timezone that the time should be displayed in when shown to a user. The
 * recorded time point is in UTC, so timezone can be ignored for comparing
 * values. See {@link #getTimezoneOffset()}.
