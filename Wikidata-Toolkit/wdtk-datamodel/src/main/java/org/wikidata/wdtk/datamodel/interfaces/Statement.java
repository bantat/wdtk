	 * Return the id used to identify this statement.

	 * Statement ids are used by Wikibase to allow certain interactions though
	 * the API, especially the atomic modification of Statements (modifications
	 * of statements can be viewed as deletions followed by insertions, but
	 * doing this in several steps though the API is not practical). In the
	 * current Wikibase implementation, the id is a string that begins with the
	 * (sometimes lowercased) local ID of the subject of the statement, followed
	 * by a dollar sign and a randomly generated UUID. Thus statements of
	 * different subjects can never have the same id, and it is extremely
	 * unlikely that two statements of the one subject ever have the same id.
	 * However, it is possible that two statements with the same content differ
	 * in their id, since the id is not based on the content.
	 * <p>
	 * Wikidata Toolkit generally requires ids to be specified but you can use
	 * the empty string to indicate that a statement has no id. This will also
	 * be respected when serializing data as JSON, i.e., rather than setting the
	 * statement id to an empty string in JSON, the key will simply be omitted.
	 * This is useful for creating new statements through the API.
	 * <p>
	 * Callers should not make any assumptions about the stability of statement
	 * ids over time, or about the internal format of the ids.
