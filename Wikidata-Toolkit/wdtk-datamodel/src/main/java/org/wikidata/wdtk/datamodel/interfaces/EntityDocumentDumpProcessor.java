/**
 * Interface for classes that process a list of {@link EntityDocument} objects.
 * The difference to {@link EntityDocumentProcessor} is that there are
 * additional methods to start and end processing. They can be used to do
 * initial processing steps (open files, write headers etc.) and final
 * processing steps (closing files etc.), respectively.
 * <p>
 * Implementations expect callers to invoke the methods in a strict order: first
 * {@link #open()}, followed by any number of calls to
 * {@link #processItemDocument(ItemDocument)} and
 * {@link #processPropertyDocument(PropertyDocument)}, and finally
 * {@link #close()}. Any other order of invocation may lead to undefined
 * results. In particular, implementations are not expected to guard against
 * such wrong use.
