/**
 * An entity is a Value that is represented by a page in Wikibase. It is
 * identified by its id, corresponding to the title of that page. Typical
 * entities are Items (with identifiers of the form Q1234) and Properties (with
 * identifiers of the form P1234).
 * <p>
 * When considering entities from multiple sites, the (local) ID alone is not
 * enough to identify an entity unambiguously. In this case, the site IRI also
 * needs to be taken into account.
 * <p>
 * An alternative to using the local ID and site IRI together is to use the full
 * IRI. By default, this is computed by appending the local ID to the site IRI.
 * However, for some sites and some entity types, more elaborate computations
 * might be required, so this construction scheme for IRIs should not be
 * presumed.
 * <p>
 * The full IRI of an entity is used in export formats like RDF, but also
 * internally, e.g., for identifying the calendar model of time values.
