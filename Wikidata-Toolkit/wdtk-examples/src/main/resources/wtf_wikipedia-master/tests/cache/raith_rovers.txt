The club was founded in 1883 and currently competes in the [[Scottish Championship]] as a member of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]], having been promoted from the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] as champions in 2009. The club's highest ever league position came in [[1921–22 in Scottish football|1922]], when it finished third behind champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and runners-up [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in Division One. The club has won two national trophies, the [[Scottish League Cup]] in [[1994 Scottish League Cup Final|1994]] by [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] and on 6 April 2014, Rovers won the [[2013–14 Scottish Challenge Cup]] after beating [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 1–0 with a late goal from [[John Baird (footballer born 1985)|John Baird]] in extra time. The club also came runners-up in [[1949 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|1949]] as well as being losing finalists in the 1913 Scottish Cup Final. Below the top flight of Scottish football the club has won the second tier five times, coming runners-up on the same number of occasions, the last coming in [[2010–11 Scottish First Division|2010–11]] behind rivals [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]]. As a result of winning the League Cup in 1994, Raith Rovers qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]] the following season. The club managed to reach the [[1995–96 UEFA Cup#Second round|second round]], only to be defeated 4–1 [[Two-legged tie|on aggregate]] to eventual champions [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Raith's home ground is [[Stark's Park]], an {{SPFL-stadiums|raith}}<ref name="capacity">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/raith/ |title=Raith Rovers Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> [[all-seater stadium]] in the south of [[Kirkcaldy]]. The club has been based at the ground since 1891. ==History== ===Beginnings and club name=== [[File:Stark's Park - geograph.org.uk - 204446.jpg|thumb|right|Stark's Park, home of Raith Rovers]] The modern Raith Rovers were founded in 1883 in the Scottish town of Kirkcaldy, playing at [[Kirkcaldy#Public parks|Robbie's Park]]. Though there were other teams who incorporated the town name, such as Kirkcaldy Wanderers and [[Kirkcaldy United F.C.|Kirkcaldy United]], Raith became the most successful of the local teams, winning five trophies in the 1890s.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /> There had been a much earlier (and unrelated) Raith Rovers which merged with what is now [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] in 1882. Although it lends its name to many entities in the region, Raith is not itself a settlement. A Raith Rovers victory in the 1960s led to a famous [[BBC]] [[Colemanballs|commentator's blunder]] that the fans would be ''"dancing in the streets of Raith tonight"''. Although commonly attributed to [[England|Englishman]] [[David Coleman]], this was actually said by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sam Leitch]].<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> [[Raith, Fife|Raith]] ({{lang-gd|[[Ringfort|rath]]}}, "fort" or "fortified residence") as an area once stretched from south of [[List of lochs in Scotland#G|Loch Gelly]] as far as Kirkcaldy<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title=The Place-Names of Fife, Volume One|year=2006|publisher=Shaun Tyas|isbn=1-900289-77-6|pages=496|author2=Gilbert Markus }}</ref> and the [[Battle of Raith]] is said to have been fought here in 596 AD.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered">{{cite book | author = Kirkcaldy Civic Society | title = Kirkcaldy Remembered, 2nd edition | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-84588-386-7}}</ref> Raith House and Raith Tower sit on Cormie Hill to the west of Kirkcaldy and several parts of the town are built on land formerly of the Raith Estate,<ref>{{cite book|title=Kirkcaldy's Famous Folk, Volume 3|year=2000|publisher=Kirkcaldy Civic Society|pages=13}}</ref> although the modern housing estate bearing the Raith name dates from long after the origins of the team. A mixture of local success and ambition took the club into the senior leagues where they established themselves and thereby became the pre-eminent team in the town. The club became a senior team in 1889 around the same time they were forced to leave Robbie's Park which was incorporated into a new public park called the [[Kirkcaldy#Public parks|Beveridge Park]], named after Provost Michael Beveridge.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> The team subsequently moved to their current home of [[Stark's Park]] named after and run by councillor Robert Stark in 1891.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration">{{cite book | author = Kirkcaldy Civic Society | title = Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration | publisher = The Francis Firth Collection | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-84567-749-8}}</ref> The club turned professional by 1892 and were the first football team in Fife to be elected to the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in season 1902–03<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered" /><ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> The club were incorporated into a limited company: the Raith Rovers Football and Athletic Company, Ltd by 1907. After two consecutive successful seasons in [[Scottish Football League Second Division|2nd Division]], the club elected to join the [[Scottish Football League First Division|1st Division]] in 1909–10. Three years later, the club made their first (and only) appearance in the [[Scottish Cup]] Final losing 2–0 to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]. ===Setting records=== In 1921 an innovation in training, previously unknown to the Scottish game, was introduced by directors following a visit to England: the use of a ball in training. As noted in the [[Fife Free Press]], "Hitherto, ball practice has been an absentee from the training curriculum on the grounds that being away from the ball for a week imparted eagerness on the Saturday." This heralded an era of success.<ref name=Stramash>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Daniel|title=Stramash|year=2010|publisher=Luath Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-906817-66-4|pages=109–110}}</ref> The club had its highest ever league finish in the Scottish top division, when they came third to the Old Firm in 1921–22. This was followed by the unusual incident where the players were shipwrecked in 1923. The team had been en route to play friendly matches on the [[Canary Islands]] when the boat ran aground. Fortunately, the players were able to safely disembark and continue on their way a few days later.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration"/> The team battled on during tough times between the 1920s and 1930s but things improved by the season of 1937–38 saw Raith setting a British League Record with 142 goals in just 34 league matches while winning the 2nd Division championship.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> The record still stands today. The forward line of Glen (5 goals), Gilmour (35), [[Norrie Haywood]] (47), Whitelaw (26) and Joyner (21) scored 134 of the record 142 goals. Around this time, a then record crowd of 25,500 filled Stark's Park on a Wednesday afternoon for a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against East Fife (The first game had attracted 19,000 to the old Bayview ground). East Fife won 3–2 and went on to become the only 2nd Division club to win the Scottish Cup. Record appearance holder [[Willie McNaught]] first appeared for Raith during the war before signing on a contract basis when normal football resumed after the end of global hostilities. McNaught went on to make 657 senior football appearances (many as captain) for Rovers. Raith reached the League Cup final for the first time in 1948–49 but lost 2–0 to [[Glasgow Rangers FC|Rangers]]. In an echo of what would happen four decades later, the club also went on to win the 2nd Division title. In the period of the club's greatest high level consistency, Rovers stayed in the top division until the season after McNaught's 1962 departure. In 1951, Raith had their largest ever gate for a Scottish Cup semi-final at [[Hampden Park]] watched by a crowd of 84,640. Raith lost 3–2 to [[Glasgow Celtic FC|Celtic]]. ===Promotions, relegations and ''Player of the Year''=== A disastrous season came in 1962–63, when the club finished bottom of the First Division conceding 118 goals in 34 games.<ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> After leaving [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], [[George Farm]] became Raith manager in 1964.<ref name=autogeneratedqos>{{cite web|url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1051|title=QosFC: Legends - George Farm|publisher=}}</ref> Farm took Raith to promotion in 1966–67 before leaving for Fife rivals [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and was never able to repeat the forumale when he returned in the season of 1971–72.<ref name="Rovers Recalled">{{cite book | last = Litster | first = John | title = Rovers Recalled: Raith Rovers in pictures through the years, Volume 1 | publisher = John Litster | isbn = 0-9534682-1-6}}</ref> Raith managed to avoid relegation in 1967–68, thanks to [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Gordon Wallace (Scottish footballer)|Gordon Wallace]], who became the first player outwith the Old Firm to be voted Player of the Year. He scored 27 goals in 34 matches.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> Although, the club did find themselves being relegated again at the end of the 1969–70 season.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> Nonetheless, the Rovers during this time managed to get through to the quarter finals of the Scottish cup for the second year running between 1970–71 and 1971–72&nbsp;– although the latter saw them beaten 3–1 by [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] with a crowd of 10,815.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> In 1975–76, the league set-up changed from Divisions 1 & 2 to a 3 tier system (Premier Division, Division 1 & Division 2). In the inaugural year of this system, Raith were promoted to the 1st Division, but were promptly relegated the next season, before bouncing back up the season after. Raith then performed reasonably well in the 1st Division, hovering around the top four until the early 1980s. A new manager, [[Frank Connor]] took charge in early 1986, bringing many new faces onto the team which resulted in promotion on goal difference after a 4–1 win against Stranraer (while [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] lost to [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]]) on the last day of the season.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> ===The League Cup winning era=== Raith reverted to being a full-time side again for the season of 1991–92 which was soon followed by winning the First Division title in the season of 1992–93.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> This was to start the most successful period in the club's history&nbsp;– which saw the team's first foray into the [[Scottish Premier Division]] (now the Premiership) but was only short-lived.<ref name="RRFC 1991-92-1995–96">{{cite book | last = Fimister | first = Tony | title = Raith Rovers Football Club 1991–92&nbsp;– 1995–96 | publisher = Tempus Publishing Ltd | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7524-2425-4}}</ref> On 27 November 1994, Raith, managed by Jimmy Nicholl, surprisingly beat Celtic 6–5 on penalties to win the [[Scottish League Cup|Coca Cola Cup]], after a 2–2 draw.<ref name="Kirkcaldy Remembered"/><ref name="Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration" /> Future Raith manager, [[Gordon Dalziel]], scored the equalising goal for Raith in the dying minutes of regulation time. The same season, Raith were again promoted to the Premier Division after winning the First Division title. As a result of the Cup win, Raith qualified for Europe ([[UEFA Cup]]) for the first time in their history. After eliminating both the [[Faroes]]e and Icelandic champions ([[GÍ Gøta]] and [[ÍA Akranes]] respectively) in the first two rounds, the club finally succumbed to eventual UEFA Cup winners [[Bayern Munich]]. They were beaten 2–0 by the [[Football in Germany|German]] side in the 1st leg, which was not played at their home ground but at [[Easter Road]], home of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. In the 2nd leg, at the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] they led 1–0 at half time against all odds, eventually losing 2–1.<ref name="Rovers Recalled" /> This was the first time a Scottish team had qualified for a major European competition while playing outside the top league. The same season, Raith finished sixth in the Premier League. Winning the Coca Cola Cup, selling [[Steve McAnespie]] and playing in the UEFA Cup generated the money needed to redevelop Stark's Park as an all-seater ground with North and South Stands. It was completed in time for the 1995–96 season, and Bayern Munich were invited to play a friendly in the first match in the redeveloped ground, with Raith securing a narrow 1–0 win. ===The end of the fairytale=== After the club were relegated from the Premier Division, they also struggled to succeed in the First Division. For the 2001–02 season they were relegated to the Second Division for the first time since 1987. The club returned to the First Division (with the lowest winning total, to date, for champions of 59 points), under the leadership of [[Antonio Calderón]] in 2002–03 season. At the start of the 2004–05 season, [[Claude Anelka]] (brother of French Striker [[Nicolas Anelka|Nicolas]]) offered £300,000 to any team who would offer him a manager's job and was subsequently appointed the manager of Raith Rovers, with Antonio Calderón refusing the offer of a coaching role and leaving the club. Anelka signed a team of (mostly) continental players from the lower leagues in France. A disastrous season followed, despite Anelka resigning halfway through the season (replaced by [[Gordon Dalziel]]) and his signings either leaving, or having their contracts terminated, Raith were relegated to the Second Division after finishing bottom of the First Division with just 16 points in the season. ===Local takeover=== During 2005–06, the future of the club looked doubtful after the club and its traditional home of [[Stark's Park]] were both placed under threat by previous owners Colin McGowan and Alex Short. The [[Glasgow]] based [[property developer]]s had repeatedly threatened to sell Stark's Park for housing in a bid to find a buyer for their 50% stake in the club and after months of legal and financial wrangling a deal was struck with their company, West City Development. Former chairman Turnbull Hutton and director Mario Caira, who were part of West City retained their investment and have been joined by major investor John Sim, a [[Thailand]]-based senior financial figure with [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] [[KPMG]]. The ''Reclaim the Rovers'' fans' campaign, which was launched in a bid to secure a local future for the club, has also secured a place for a Supporters' Representative, on the new-look board after raising £100,000 towards the final figure. On 30 December 2005, Raith Rovers' future was secured after a £1.2&nbsp;million community buy-out (The New Raith Rovers Limited consortium) assisted by the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] who became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and is a fan and shareholder<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7939377.stm|title=Ministers reveal their interests|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref> of the club. Previous chairman [[David Sinton]] also completed work on the takeover. On 2 May 2009, Raith secured the [[2008–09 Scottish Second Division|Second Division title]] with a 1–0 win at the home of Scottish football, Hampden Park, with a travelling support of over 1500. They lifted the trophy in front of almost 5000 the following week following a 0–0 draw with Arbroath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/8038849.stm|title=Raith Rovers 0–0 Arbroath |date=9 May 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> As of 2011–12, Raith operate with a squad comprising a mixture of full and part-time professionals.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jimspence/2011/12/part-time_route_may_be_prudent.html Part-time route may be prudent for Scotland's clubs] BBC, 15 December 2011</ref> On 6 April 2014, Raith won the [[2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]] 1–0 against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] after extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/raith-rovers-1-0-rangers-aet-glory-for-raith-1-3367123|title=Glory for Raith |date=6 April 2014|work=Scotsman|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> ==Colours and badge== Raith's kit consists of white tops with navy blue detailing, with white shorts and navy blue socks.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013/14 Kit Revealed|url=http://www.raithrovers.net/9017/201314-kit-revealed.htm|publisher=Raith Rovers F.C.|date=15 May 2013}}</ref> The away kit consists of a red shirt with blue detailing with red shorts and socks, this has not changed entering the new season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raith Rovers Away Kit|url=http://www.raithrovers.net/4025/raith-rovers-away-kit.htm|publisher=Raith Rovers F.C.|date=9 July 2012}}</ref> Raith's current badge has been used since 1998,<ref name = "HFK">{{cite web|title=Raith Rovers|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Raith_Rovers/Raith_Rovers.htm|publisher=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> replacing the previous lion and shield motif used in different colour combinations (including being framed in a shield shape from 1995 to 1998) since 1985.<ref name="HFK"/> ==Stadium== {{Main article|Stark's Park}} ==Fife rivalries== {{main article|Fife derby}} There are three other senior league teams in Fife with [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] around 8 miles to the east, and [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] 9 and 14 miles respectively to the west.
