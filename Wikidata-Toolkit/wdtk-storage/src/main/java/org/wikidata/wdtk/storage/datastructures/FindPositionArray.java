/**
 * This class keeps the positions where the <i>n</i>-th <i>bit</i> value can be
 * found in a bit vector (<i>bit</i> can be <code>true</code> or
 * <code>false</code>). This class uses an array to store these positions. Each
 * cell of the array covers a block in the bit vector, and to find the positions
 * in this block, the method iterates on the bit vector.
 * <p>
 * For example, let us suppose we have the following bit vector: 11010001 (0 is
 * <code>false</code> and 1 is <code>true</code>), with a block size of 2. For
 * the case of <code>true</code>, the array stores the position where
 * <code>true</code> is found for the zeroth occurrence, the second occurrence,
 * the forth occurrence, and so on and so forth. The first cell of the array
 * contains -1. This convention comes handy because the zeroth occurrence is
 * undefined and the first occurrence needs to be found in the following cell of
 * the bit vector, i.e. at position 0. Anyway, since the zeroth occurrence is
 * not defined, the {@link #findPosition(long)} method returns
 * {@link RankedBitVector.NOT_FOUND} for that value.
 * <p>
 * The array for <code>true</code> is [-1, 1, 7]. The second occurrence of
 * <code>true</code> is at position 1 in the bit vector. The forth occurrence of
 * <code>true</code> is at position 7 in the bit vector. Analogously, the array
 * for <code>false</code> is [-1, 4, 6]. The positions of <code>false</code> are
 * 4 for the second occurrence, and 6 for the forth occurrence.
 * <p>
 * Please observe that the blocks have the same size in number of occurrences,
 * but may cover different number of positions in the bit vector.
 * <p>
 * For efficiency reasons, this class assumes that the bit vector is unmodified.
 * Any modification of the bit vector needs to be notified in
 * {@link FindPositionArray#update()}.
